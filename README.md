We have a database named "dzFoot"

In order to create the database, we have to run: 
        Creation_dzFoot_2020 (1).sql
And insert the data through:
        Insertion_dzFoot_2020 (1).sql
        
        
        
        
The rest of the files are some  SQL queries examples: 


 FastestBut.sql: is a query that returns the fastest goal

 NbPoints.sql: is a query that returns the number of goals of each team order DESC

 meuilleurButteur.sql: is a query that returns the player who scored the most points

 winAller.sql: is a query that returns the team who won the first leg "match" between two specified teams

 moinsDefaites.sql: is a query that returns the team who lost the least

 moyRenc.sql: is a query that returns the average of the total matches

 ChampionAlg.sql: is a query that returns the champion of Alg

Here is the diagram that shows our Database
